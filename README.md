This is a repository to record my study pace of SQL. All of my codes are based on MySQL Workbench.

On 02/09/2024, what I've learned is as follows:

1) create database and table;
2) insert values into table;
3) define primary key, foreign key and character type;
4) alter something in a table;
5) select * from `table_name`;
